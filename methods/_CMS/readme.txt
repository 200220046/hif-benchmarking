This package contains the Matlab codes about our method CMS described in TIP-2017paper "Exploiting Clustering Manifold Structure for Hyperspectral Imagery Super-Resolution".

Run runCMS.m is the main function for the super-resolution.

An example image 'fake_and_real_lemons' from CAVE dataset is included in folder 'data', which can be used to test the code.

For any questions, feel free to email me at zhanglei211@mail.nwpu.edu.cn. or gyf@mail.nwpu.edu.cn.

After using this code, please cite our paper as follows
